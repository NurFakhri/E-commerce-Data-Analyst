# E-commerce Data Analyst ðŸ›’

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce data, starting from formulating questions to answering them using exploratory data analysis (EDA). Some of the key questions addressed in this analysis include:  
- Which products receive the most positive and negative reviews?  
- Are certain products more popular or frequently purchased in specific regions?  
- What is the success rate of product deliveries?  

The project was part of the tasks in a **Dicoding** course, where we explore and apply data analysis techniques in real-world scenarios.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains various details related to e-commerce transactions, including product reviews, purchase information, customer demographics, and delivery success. This data allows for deep insights into customer behavior, product performance, and regional differences in purchasing preferences.

## Dependencies
To get started, you need to install the required dependencies. You can install them by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Methodology
The following steps were taken in this analysis:
1. **Import Libraries**: Import necessary Python libraries for data processing and analysis.
2. **Data Wrangling**: Clean and prepare the data by handling missing values, correcting data types, and merging relevant data sources.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform EDA to uncover insights related to product reviews, popularity across regions, and delivery success.
4. **Web Application**: Build a simple web application using **Streamlit** to visualize and interact with the analysis results.

## Result
### Conclusion for Problem 1:
The product that receives the most positive and negative reviews is the same item. This product is also the highest-selling one by far. Based on this, we recommend using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to analyze customer feedback in the comment section to gain deeper insights into customer sentiment.

### Conclusion for Problem 2:
Product popularity varies significantly by region. Certain products contribute up to 20-30% of sales in specific regions. Based on this, marketing and inventory stocking strategies should be tailored to match each region's purchasing preferences for better optimization.

### Conclusion for Problem 3:
The majority of recorded items have been successfully delivered, indicating that the overall delivery process is functioning well. However, further analysis could identify potential areas for improvement in delivery efficiency.
